# Project Scope: [PROJECT NAME]

> **Claude Code Entry Point**
> Hand this document to the **full-stack-orchestrator** agent:
> `.claude/agents/full-stack-orchestrator.md`
>
> Before writing a single line of code, read:
> 1. `CLAUDE.md`
> 2. `.claude/agents/full-stack-orchestrator.md`
>
> This document is the single source of truth for Phase 1 scope.
> Do **not** build beyond what is described here.

## 1. Project Overview

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Project Name** | `[project-name]` _(lowercase, hyphenated)_ |
| **Package Scope** | `@[project-name]/` |
| **Phase** | Phase 1 — MVP |
| **Target Env** | Development → QA → Production |
| **Repo Base** | `ru5ty-gate` |

### 1.1 Business Summary

> _2–4 sentences. What does this system do? Who uses it? What problem does it solve?_
>
> Example: "A fleet tracking platform for logistics companies. Drivers submit telemetry via mobile.
> Dispatchers monitor vehicles on a real-time dashboard. Admins manage routes, drivers, and reports."

---

## 2. Design Screens

> Attach or link design files below. Claude Code will use these as the UI contract
> for all frontend pages listed in Section 7.

| Screen Name | File / Link | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Login / Auth | `designs/auth.png` or [Figma link] | |
| Dashboard | `designs/dashboard.png` | |
| [Entity] List View | `designs/[entity]-list.png` | |
| [Entity] Detail / Form | `designs/[entity]-detail.png` | |
| _(add more as needed)_ | | |

> If a design screen exists for a page, Claude Code must implement it
> faithfully using the existing component library. No creative divergence.

---

## 3. Monorepo Name Substitution

> Run this before writing any code. Replace everywhere in the repo:

| Find | Replace With |
| --- | --- |
| `ru5ty-gate` | `[project-name]` (Cargo package names, docs, images) |
| `ru5ty_gate` | `[project_name]` (Rust `use` paths) |

Locations to update: every `Cargo.toml` (package names and path dependencies), Rust `use` statements, all `package.json` files, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `docker-compose.yaml`, `CLAUDE.md`, all `.claude/agents/*.md`, all `.claude/commands/*.md`, all `.claude/instructions/*.md`.

---

## 4. Domain Entities

> Define every entity the system manages. Claude Code will use this to drive
> the `domain-modeler` agent and SQL migration design.

### 4.1 Entity: `[EntityName]`

| Property | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `UUID` | Yes | PK, auto-generated |
| `name` | `VARCHAR(255)` | Yes | |
| `status` | `Enum` | Yes | Values: `ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE` |
| `tenant_id` | `UUID` | Yes | FK → `Tenant` |
| `created_at` | `DateTime` | Yes | Auto |
| `updated_at` | `DateTime` | Yes | Auto |
| _(add fields)_ | | | |

**Relationships:**
- `[EntityName]` belongs to `[OtherEntity]` (many-to-one)
- `[EntityName]` has many `[ChildEntity]` (one-to-many)

**Indexes:** `[tenant_id, status]`, `[created_at DESC, id]`

**Caching:** TTL `[X]` minutes | Cache key: `[entity]:[id]` | Invalidate on: write

### 4.2 Entity: `[EntityName2]`

> _(repeat block per entity)_

---

## 5. Enums

```
[EnumName]:
  - VALUE_ONE    → description
  - VALUE_TWO    → description
  - VALUE_THREE  → description
```

---

## 6. RBAC — Roles & Permissions

> Claude Code will use `.claude/agents/rbac.md` for implementation.

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `SUPER_ADMIN` | Full system access |
| `MODERATOR` | _(describe scope)_ |
| `SUPPORT` | _(describe scope)_ |
| `CHAT_USER` | _(describe scope)_ |
| _(add roles)_ | |

### Permission Matrix

| Resource | SUPER_ADMIN | MODERATOR | SUPPORT | CHAT_USER |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `[entity]:read` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `[entity]:write` | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| `[entity]:delete` | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| _(add more)_ | | | | |

---

## 7. Backend Services & API Endpoints

> Services live in `apps/backend/`. Claude Code will use `.claude/agents/api-builder.md`.
>
> All endpoints follow the standard response envelope: `{ isSuccessful, data?, message? }`.
> New services use `.claude/agents/new-service-scaffold.md`.

### 7.1 Service: `[service-name]-api`

**Base path:** `/api/v1/[resource]`

| Method | Path | Auth | Role Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/[resource]` | JWT | `SUPER_ADMIN` | Create [entity] |
| `GET` | `/[resource]` | JWT | `CHAT_USER` | List [entities] (paginated) |
| `GET` | `/[resource]/:id` | JWT | `CHAT_USER` | Get single [entity] |
| `PUT` | `/[resource]/:id` | JWT | `SUPER_ADMIN` | Update [entity] |
| `DELETE` | `/[resource]/:id` | JWT | `SUPER_ADMIN` | Soft-delete [entity] |
| _(add)_ | | | | |

**Pagination:** Cursor-based (default) unless dataset is known-small

#### Caching Notes

- `GET /[resource]` → Cache list with key `[resource]:list:[tenantId]`, TTL `5m`
- `GET /[resource]/:id` → Cache item with key `[resource]:[id]`, TTL `10m`
- Invalidate list cache on any write

### 7.2 Service: `[service-name-2]-api`

> _(repeat block per service)_

---

## 8. Background Jobs (Redis queue / scheduled jobs)

> Claude Code will use the `common/queue` crate or a `schedule-api` job.

| Queue Name | Trigger | Job Description | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[queue-name]` | POST `/[resource]` | Send confirmation email | Normal |
| `[queue-name-2]` | CRON `0 8 * * *` | Generate daily report | Low |

- Coverage thresholds: branches 75%, functions 80%, lines 80%
- Test DB: `TEST_DATABASE_URL` separate from dev DB

---

## 14. Environment Variables

List every env var this project needs across all services. This drives `.env.example` generation.
